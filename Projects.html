        <h3>Aman Setu-My school</h3>
            <p> Established under the aegis of MKF in 2008, the school is located on the Lohegaon-Wagholi Road which is a green and beautiful part of Pune. The school is currently up to Standard 8. The school functions on the philosophy of learning by doing, learning from nature and learning in an integrated manner.
            <br><br>
            Environmental awareness: <br>
            The school is constructed from material which causes the least damage to the environment – this also helps set an example for the students about our commitment towards the Earth. The green school experiment pioneered at Aman Setu has won worldwide recognition and has featured in hundreds of newspapers and journals across the globe ( Google The recycled school , India). Hundred percent of the students and staff travel by school buses. Private transport, cars, scooters and rickshaws are not allowed so as to create minimum damage to the environment.
            <br><br>
            Financial Support to Students: <br>
            True to our name ‘Setu’ we have made a conscious decision to take children from the various strata of society- economic, social and cultural as a sincere effort from us to bridge the gap between them. The current strength of the school is 300 children. Of these some students are offered scholarship and financial aid according to their means.The balance amount is borne by the Foundation.
            <br><br>
            Children with Special Needs (Handicaps): <br>
            The school also includes children with special educational needs such as autistic children, Down’s syndrome children, cases of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.Children with emotional issues and behavior problems also find a haven here. Counselors and special educators work in collaboration with teachers and parents to design interventions that help these children to adjust and develop their skills. Extra facilities and special tutors are provided by the school.</p>

        <h3>Kaleidoscope - Expanding the Scope of Schools</h3>
        <br>
        <p>While on the one hand the mainstream school plays a well defined role in society, preparing students to enter college, to earn a living and contribute to the economy, there are educators in many pockets who have challenged this understanding of education. Over the last few centuries many teachers/ philosophers have insisted that schools are not cogs in the economic structure. Schools do not exist to train the work force, bolster existing social institutions, create tractable citizens and maintain the divides in society. Their very purpose is to challenge the status quo, create divergent thinkers, inspire change and transform lives and hence society. By creating a learning space like Kaleidoscope we are living up to Gandhijis direction to the change we want to see in the world. Not only is the earth bag and bamboo structure lower in cost, kinder to the earth, aesthetically satisfying, cool and comfortable, but it is also a dynamic learning space. It lives the message of our school, its structure facilitating equal opportunity to participate. Kaleidoscope has just the right nurturing energy, suitable for a learning space. 
        We invite you to come and experience it.</p>

Partnership with National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT), Delhi 

The team at MKF has helped design and execute training modules for master trainers in Maharashtra under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. These trainers have fanned out to cover thousands of mainstream government school teachers across Maharashtra and later across India.


ZHEP  

A Remedial Centre run by the Pune Cantonment Board (P.C.B.) in collaboration with the
Madhavi Kapur Foundation (MKF). ZHEP provides services to children who are not performing well in the PCB school by designing Individual Education Programmes (IEPs) and providing counseling and remediation, play therapy and other interventions. The Centre also has resource persons coming in for Art, Music and Drama . 40 children from nine P.C.B. schools come to the centre regularly. The children receive Language and Math remedial inputs.


Bharari Outreach Project

This project, in collaboration with the Kirloskar Pneumatic social work team, focuses on 240 vulnerable children from Zilla Parishad schools who are at risk of dropping out before completing school. Our team works intensively to give academic support, learning skills, literacy inputs, emotional support, guidance to teachers and parents.This project has completed 6 years for which it has won many awards.


Khel Khel Mein Toy Library 

Khel Khel Mein toy Library is a very special idea. The Wockhardt Foundation had conceptualized a model of partnership across the social divide to make it possible for advantaged children to share their joys with those children who cannot afford toys. MKF has designed the Toy Library programme and the training for Toy Library teachers. We have effectively created a circle of sharing including toy manufacturers, Rotary Clubs, corporate houses, church groups, children who have a surfeit of toys and learning material and those who have none. 14 toy libraries currently run in Mumbai under this project.


Steps Remedial Centre 

MKF has provided the technical help and training to establish a remedial centre in the Pimpri Chinchwad area. This is located in the Priyadarshini school there and provides diagnosos and remedial coaching to children with special learning needs in that locality.

Digital Study Hall (DSH)- This project, in collaboration with a school in Lucknow, has a wide outreach. It is a way to farm out concrete teaching methods to the mainstream government schools. Our team goes out into the local ZP school in Lohegaon everyday to teach in Classes 1 and 2. The subjects we focus on are English, Maths and Environmental studies. Classes are taken by our teachers demonstrating how easily and cheaply available materials can be used to make learning practical and meaningful. These lessons are video recorded, edited and sub titled. Then teachers in 4 ZP schools in Saswad are shown how to use these recordings in their schools to teach children and also to improve their own teaching repertoire.-->
