        <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
        <p>At a time when India is muscling its way on to the international arena as an economic, technological and cultural force to contend with, education is increasingly being considered a vital developmental sector. Ironically, there is still an urgent need for professionally managed schools that cultivate responsible, sensitive, motivated and welladjusted young people who will not only be able to face the challenges of a new India, but also emerge as initiators and leaders in their chosen disciplines. The country boasts of premier national institutes, colleges of learning and training and select progressive schools. There is still a need for more replicable models that are both scale-able and accessible. Indian education is at a very important point where critical adjustments and choices will need to be made. It calls for a merging of the 'old' and the 'new', the 'traditional' and the 'modern'. It needs to respond to the changing socio-economic structure of our society, emphasizing the leveling of class factors. The projects undertaken by the Foundation all aim to bring people together across class, caste, communal, linguistic and language divides.</p>
